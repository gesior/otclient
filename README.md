### What is this fork?

It's 100% automatic map image generator [for website view 'like GoogleMaps'].
It generates OTS map .png images (each 8x8 tiles).
It can also generate house images for website.

### How to use?

GENERATE PNG IMAGES FROM OTBM
-----------------------
1. Compile it like normal OTClient:
    
    https://github.com/edubart/otclient/wiki/Compiling-on-Windows
    
    https://github.com/edubart/otclient/wiki/Compiling-on-Linux
    
    https://github.com/edubart/otclient/wiki/Compiling-on-Mac-OS-X
    
    https://github.com/edubart/otclient/wiki/Compiling-for-Android

        You can also download binary file from GitHub Releases

2. Copy your server **client .spr and .dat** files to OTClient folder: **data/things/HERE_PROTOCOL_VERSION/**

3. Copy your server **data/items/items.otb** file to OTClient folder: **data/things/HERE_PROTOCOL_VERSION/**

4. Copy your server **data/world/MAP_NAME.otbm** file to OTClient folder: **data/map.otbm**

5. Run **otclient.exe**

6. Type in client terminal command like:
    
   **prepareClient(1076, '/things/1076/items.otb', '/map.otbm', 8, 5)**
    
	- with you client protocol version,
	
	- valid paths to items.otb and map.otbm,
	
	- number of threads to run (in example it's 8),
	
	- number of map parts (OTC will split map to parts to reduce maximum RAM usage)
	
	[Paths are relational, so start path with '/' to start in folder 'data', access to other folders in computer is blocked]

7. OTClient will show after 10-50 seconds (it will freez client, do not close it, just wait) something like:

	Now just type (lower levels shadow 30%)
	ALL PARTS OF MAP:
	generateMap('all', 30)
	ONLY PARTS 2 AND 3 OF MAP:
	generateMap({2, 3}, 30)

8. Type in client terminal command:
		
	**generateMap('all', 30)**
		
	OTClient will report progress in terminal.

9. Your map images will appear in OTClient directory

	**exported_images/map** - open it in folder explorer

10. Copy directory **map** from **exported_images** directory to directory **website_and_php_files** of otclient_mapgen.

    --- NEXT STEPS REQUIRE **PHP** INSTALLED IN SYSTEM ---
    
    --- LINUX: FOR GENERATION TIME, SET FOLDER **website_and_php_files** RIGHTS TO 777 ---

GENERATE MAP ZOOM LEVELS FOR WEBSITE
-----------------------
### Linux

1. Execute (in terminal):

    **sh linux_run_all.sh**

### Windows

##### 1. If you got Git BASH installed

1. Execute (in system terminal):

	**./windows_run_1_pre_tile_generator.sh**

2. Execute:

	**./windows_run_2_tile_generator.sh**

    Watch CPU usage (by php.exe). Wait until it finish.

3. Execute:

	**./windows_run_3_pre_compress.sh**

4. Execute:

	**./windows_run_4_compress.sh**

    Watch CPU usage (by php.exe). Wait until it finish.

##### 2. If you do not have Git BASH

1. Execute (in system terminal):

	**php 1_pre_tile_generator.php**

2. Execute (command parameter is map 'floor'):
    - You can execute these commands in any order.
    - You can open few terminals and run few commands at once to generate it faster (use all CPU cores).

	**php 2_tile_generator.php 0**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 1**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 2**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 3**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 4**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 5**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 6**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 7**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 8**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 9**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 10**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 11**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 12**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 13**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 14**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 15**
	
	**php 2_tile_generator.php 16**

3. Execute:

	**php 3_pre_compress.php**

4. Execute (command parameter is map 'floor'):
    - You can set compression quality in file 4_compress.php (line: $quality = 80;)
    - You can execute these commands in any order.
    - You can open few terminals and run few commands at once to generate it faster (use all CPU cores).

	**php 4_compress.php 0**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 1**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 2**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 3**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 4**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 5**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 6**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 7**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 8**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 9**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 10**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 11**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 12**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 13**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 14**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 15**
	
	**php 4_compress.php 16**

## Setup website
15. Move folder **website_and_php_files/map_viewer** to your webserver - it contains all images and website scripts to view them (Leaflet Map).

16. Configure map_viewer. Config is at start of **map.js** file:
- You can keep images on other webserver. Set **imagesUrl** to URL of your server starting with 'http' (or 'https'): 'http://myserver.com/map_images/'
```
    imagesUrl: 'map/', // URL to folder with 'zoom levels' (folders with names 0-16)
    imagesExtension: '.jpg',
    mapName: 'RL MAP?',
    startPosition: {x: 32000, y: 32000, z: 7},
    startZoom: 14,
    minZoom: 4,
    maxZoom: 18, // maximum zoom with full quality is 16
```

GENERATE HOUSE IMAGES
-----------------------

1. Do steps 1-6 from **GENERATE PNG IMAGES FROM OTBM** instruction (above).

2. Type in client terminal command:
    
   **generateHouses(30, false)**
    
	- **30** - shadow percent for tiles around house (they will be darker)
	
	- **false** - load whole map at once, requires much RAM, set it to **true** to load map by parts,
	it's much slower, but will use little amount of RAM to generate house images

    **It will freez client for house generation time!** Don't close it.
    If you want watch progress run OTClient by windows/linux console (not by clicking .exe):

    ./otclient

    'Freezed' client will show messages about generated houses in system console.

3. Your house images will appear in OTClient directory:

	**exported_images/house/**

GENERATE FULL MINIMAP FOR OTCLIENT
-----------------------

1. Do steps 1-6 from **GENERATE PNG IMAGES FROM OTBM** instruction (above).

2. Type in client terminal command:
    
   **saveMinimap('minimap.otmm')**

3. Your minimap will appear in your system 'user' directory:

	**%HOMEPATH%/otclient/** - Windows, open it in folder explorer
	
	**${HOME}/.otclient/** - Linux, 'cd' to it, this folder is invisible, but you can navigate to it

4. Copy it to folder **data** in your normal OTClient.
It must be closed when you place there new minimap!

5. Run your OTClient, login to game, you should see full minimap.
